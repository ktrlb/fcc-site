## 1. Enable Vercel Blob

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Log in to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)

3. Select **"Blob"** from the available options
4. Click **"Continue"** and follow the setup wizard

### Step 3: Get Your Environment Variables
After enabling Blob, Vercel will automatically add these environment variables to your project:
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - Your API token for blob operations

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

### For Local Development
Add this to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Vercel Blob (automatically set in production)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your-blob-token-here"
```

### For Production
Vercel automatically sets the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in your production environment, so no additional configuration is needed!

## 3. Test the Setup

### Option 1: Test via Admin Panel
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/admin` and log in
3. Try uploading an asset through the admin interface

### Option 2: Test via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/assets/upload \
  -F "file=@/path/to/test-image.jpg" \
  -F "name=Test Image" \
  -F "type=image" \
  -F "isFeatured=false"
```

## 4. File Organization

Your Vercel Blob storage will be organized as follows:
```
blob-storage/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ seasonal_guide/

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN is not defined"**
   - Make sure you've enabled Blob storage in your Vercel project
   - Check that the environment variable is set in your `.env.local`

2. **Upload fails in development**
   - Ensure you have the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in your local environment
   - Check that your file size is under 10MB

3. **Files not accessible**
   - Vercel Blob URLs are public by default
   - Check that the URL is correctly stored in your database

### Debug Mode
Add this to see detailed logs:
```javascript
// In your upload route
console.log('Upload result:', uploadResult);
```

## 10. Migration from Local Storage

If you have existing files in your `public/uploads` folder:
1. Upload them through the admin interface
2. Update any hardcoded URLs in your database
3. Remove the old files from `public/uploads`

## 11. Best Practices

1. **Organize by Type**: Use the automatic folder organization
2. **Validate Files**: The system validates file types and sizes
3. **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on your storage and bandwidth usage
4. **Clean Up**: Delete unused assets to save storage costs
5. **Optimize Images**: Consider compressing images before upload

## 12. Advanced Features

### Custom File Names
The system automatically generates unique filenames with timestamps to prevent conflicts.

### File Validation
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Allowed types: PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, MP4, MOV, DOC, DOCX, TXT, MD

### Metadata Storage
Each file stores:
- Original filename
- Upload timestamp
- File type and size
