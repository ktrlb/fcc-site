                Every year (usually in October) we have a stewardship campaign. This is a time we challenge 
                each person in our church to assess where they are in the 5 areas of discipleship 
                (Prayer, Study, Service, Presence & Generosity).

                Each of these is an opportunity to give: of our time, our love, and our financial resources. 
                Part of this season is filling out an annual pledge card. If you missed submitting your pledge 
                in October, it&apos;s never too late. There are some physical cards in the Narthex of the church, 
                or you can pledge online.
