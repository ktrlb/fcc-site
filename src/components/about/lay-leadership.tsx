              First Christian Church is a congregationally led church, meaning our members play a vital role 
              in the governance and direction of our community. We believe that the Holy Spirit works through 
              all members of our congregation to guide our church&apos;s mission and ministry.

              Our leadership structure includes dedicated members who serve on our General Board, as Elders 
              and Deacons, and on our Mission-Vision Team. Each September, we seek nominations from our 
              congregation for leadership positions for the coming year, ensuring fresh perspectives and 
              continued growth in our church family.
