            For over 150 years, First Christian Church has been a cornerstone of faith and community in Granbury. 
            From the pioneering DeSpain family who brought their faith on horseback from Alabama in 1836, to the Clark 
            family who founded our church and AddRan College in 1873, our rich history is woven into the very fabric 
            of this community. AddRan College, established by our founding family, eventually became Texas Christian University (TCU), 
            one of the nation&apos;s leading universities. We&apos;ve weathered storms, celebrated joys, and grown together as a 
            diverse family of believers. Our legacy is not just about the pastâ€”it&apos;s the foundation that continues to inspire 
            our mission today as we welcome all people and work for justice, peace, and community in Granbury and beyond.
